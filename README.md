# Open Referral Transformer
This app allows you to convert data into an HSDS-compliant [datapackage](https://frictionlessdata.io/specs/data-package/).

The [Human Services Data Specification (HSDS)](https://openreferral.readthedocs.io/en/latest/hsds/) is a data model that describes health and human services. 

This transformer currently transforms data into HSDS version 1.1.

## Using
First, double check whether your data is already HSDS-compliant with the [OpenReferral Validator](https://github.com/spilio/openreferral-validator).

If it is, voila!

If it's not, proceed:

1. Make sure your CSV is saved locally. 
2. Install this library (see below).
3. In terminal, in the root of the directory housing this library, run:
```
```
